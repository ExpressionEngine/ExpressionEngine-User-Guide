# ExpressionEngineÂ® User Guide

The public user guide repository for the [ExpressionEngine](https://expressionengine.com) project. The online version of the user guide is hosted at [docs.expressionengine.com](https://docs.expressionengine.com).

## Setup

The ExpressionEngine user guide is written in human-readable Markdown and uses a simple script to generate beautiful HTML docs.

### Prerequisites

Building the docs requires Node and npm (latest stable version).

In the root of the repository, install all the dependencies:

    npm install

### Building the Docs

To build the docs:

    npm run build

To dynamically rebuild on any file changes:

    npm run watch

### Building theme assets

The documentation css and js files are located under `theme/assets-src`.

To build the theme assets, run `npm run buildAssets`. You can also dynamically rebuild the assets when a file changes: `npm run watchAssets`.

### Viewing local changes

Manually load `/build/index.html` in your browser to view your local build. For example, `file:///Users/<username>/Documents/ExpressionEngine-User-Guide/build/index.html`. You can use the side navigation to navigate to different local files, but the search functionality always takes you to the live version at docs.expressionengine.com.
