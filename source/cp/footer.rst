CP Footer
=========

The footer in the ExpressionEngine control panel is accessible from all pages in the control panel and provides easy access to installation information and ways to get help using ExpressionEngine.

Version Information
-------------------

Click the version number in the footer to see a popover containing your current ExpressionEngine build information, as well as whether or not a new version of ExpressionEngine is available. You can tell whether or not a new version of ExpressionEngine is available at a glance. If the version number is **green**, you're on the latest version. If the version number is **yellow**, there is an update available. If the version number is **red**, there is an important security update available.

Get Help
--------

On the right side of the footer, there are options to:

* **Report a bug** - If you find a glitch in ExpressionEngine, we want to hear about it! Click this link to let us know.
* **Access this user guide** - Need to reference a tag? Or wondering what a setting in the control panel does? This link will send you directly to the ExpressionEngine documentation.

License Information
-------------------

A license key is not required to use ExpressionEngine, but if you have a legacy license key the bottom right of the footer will display the licensing information for your install of ExpressionEngine.
