Discussion Forum Setup
======================

When setting up a new forum, it is typically best to do things in a
certain order.

Create a Forum Board
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before you can begin setting up your forums, you will need to have at least
one :doc:`forum board <forum_boards>` for your forums to belong to.

Set Permissions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are seven types of permissions you can set. It should be obvious
what each type of permission allows.

-  Can View Forum
-  Can View Hidden Forums
-  Can View Posts
-  Can Post
-  Can Report
-  Can Upload
-  Can Search

For each type of permission, you can determine whether or not it is
available for any of your Member Groups. Check a checkbox in a
permission column for a Member Group row if you want that Member Group
to have that permission. For instance, you might not want to allow a
particular Member Group to be able to post in your forum. If that's the
case, then make sure the "Can Post" checkbox is unchecked for that
Member Group.

The Discussion Forum module requires membership in order to post in the
forums. Non logged-in users (the "Guest" Member Group) cannot post to
the forums.

The "blank" boxes in the last column and last row allow you to easily
select or de-select an entire column or row.

Member Groups are managed under :menuselection:`Members --> Member Groups`
since Member Groups are used throughout your site and not just as part of the
forum.

Add a New Category
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once you've set the preferences and permissions you can start to
add the actual forums. First, you'll need to create at least one
"Category" for your forum. Let's imagine that your site is about sports
and politics. So, you first go to the Create New Category link in the Forum Manager. Here you could create a
"Sports" category. Later, you can create separate forums for different
types of sports. You might also create a "Politics" category.

A "category" in the Forum Module is simply a way to organize one or more
forums together.

Add your Forums
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now that you've created one or more categories, you can create forums
inside them. Use the Create New Forum link under the
category in which you're interested. For instance, under the Sports
category, you could click that link and then create a "Football" forum.
You might also create "Basketball", "Baseball", "Rugby", and "Hockey"
forums in that category.

In the Politics category you might create "Democrat", "Independent", and
"Republican" forums.

When creating your forums, you can set the "Status" for the forum. There
are three statuses:

-  **Live**: This is the normal state for a forum. It allows new
   postings.
-  **Read Only**: A Read Only forum does not permit new posts. You could
   use this status if you have a forum that you still want to keep the
   contents available for viewing but don't want anything new added. You
   can think of this as a sort of "archival" mode.
-  **Hidden**: A Hidden forum is one that is only viewable by people
   given permission to do so (via the forum permissions, as mentioned
   earlier).

Customizing Particular Forums
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After a forum has been created, you can use the Edit link for that forum
to adjust its settings.

Changing the Display Order of Forums and Categories
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Often, you won't create your categories and forums in the ultimate order
in which you'd like them displayed. In the main Forum Manager screen
you can use the drag handles to change the order of things.
Changing the order of forums will change the order of those forums within
the category. You can use the drag handles for the categories to change the
order in which the categories are displayed.
