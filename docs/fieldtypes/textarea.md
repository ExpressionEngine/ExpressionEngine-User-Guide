## Field Options

### Textarea Row Height

### Text Formatting

Specifies how the entered-text will be formatted when rendered on the front-end.

[Additional plugins](development/plugins.md) may be installed to provide more text formatting options.

### Allow Override?

When set to yes, authors can override the default text formatting for this field from the publish form to set it to a format other than what was selected as the default above.

### Text Direction

Either left-to-right, or right-to-left.

### Field Tools

Show formatting buttons to make writing markup easier, show a smiley chooser, or show a file chooser button to easily insert images or links to files.
