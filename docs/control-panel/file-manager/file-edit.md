# Files Editing

After uploading, the files can be edited. You can reach this pahe by clicking in File Manager on the file thumbnail, title, or picking "Edit" action.This includes modification of file itself (cropping, resizing, rotating) and edition of file meta information. File edit page can also be used to view detailed information in which entries and categories the file is being used.

The sections of this page are grouped into tabs for easier navigation and manipulation.

## Edit File Meta Data

This part of the control panel allows you to edit a file's meta data.

The following meta data is available:

#### Edit tab

- **Title** -- A title to use when listing the file in the File Manager.
- **Description** -- A description of the file.
- **Credit** -- Crediting the author/owner of the file.
- **Location** -- Where was the file created?

#### Categories tab

- **Categories** -- Assign the file to categories from the category group(s) assigned to the file's upload directory.

## Crop, Rotate & Resize Images

The Image Editor page of the Control Panel allows you to perform basic image editing tasks directly from ExpressionEngine. It is not intended to replace powerful image editing software such as Photoshop, but rather to provide a quick option for common tasks from within the control panel.

The Image Editor allows the following transformations:

#### Crop tab

- **Crop** -- Clip part of an image and change its width and height.

#### Rotate tab

- **Rotate** -- Rotate an image by 90Â° rotations, or flip it vertically and horizontally.

#### Resize tab

- **Resize** -- Change an image's width and height.

Note that the changes will only be applied when you save the changes. Only one transformation can be applied at a time.

## File Usage

This tab shows the list of entries where file is being used in fieldtype (File, File Grid, Fluid, Textarea, RTE) and categories where it is being used as Category Image.
