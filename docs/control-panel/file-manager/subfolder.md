# Subfolders

To help better organize the files, you can use the subfolders. In order to do that, subfolders need first to be enabled in [Upload Directory](control-panel/file-manager/upload-directories.md) preferences.

After enabling, you will see the "New folder" button in the top right, clicking which will show the folder creation dialog.

You can create folder in current location as well as any other where those are enabled. The folders can be nested.

To rename folder, use `...` dropdown and `Rename` option.
