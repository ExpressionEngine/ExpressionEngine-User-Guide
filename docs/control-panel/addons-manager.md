# Add-On Manager

**Control Panel Location: `Developer > Add-Ons`**

This section of the Control Panel is where add-on functionality is installed, updated, configured, and removed. They can be filtered by status and developer, and sorted by the add-on name and version. This section is divided into to sections, one for add-on functionality included with ExpressionEngine, and one for third party add-ons.

See [Installing Add-ons](add-ons/overview.md#installing-add-ons) to learn how to install an add-on.
