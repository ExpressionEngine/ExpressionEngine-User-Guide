# Rich Text Editor Javascript

[TOC]

ExpressionEngine's rich text editor has a clean API that hides away a lot of the finicky browser differences.

## Prerequisites

Before you dive into RTE button development, please make sure that you have a solid understanding of [ranges and selections](development/control-panel-js/rangesandselections.md).

You should also familiarize yourself with the [WysiHat API](development/control-panel-js/wysihat-api.md).

## Registering Buttons

Buttons are loaded into the editor in two distinct steps. First they must be registered with WysiHat. Then they can be added to the WysiHat toolbar using just their shortname.

To register a button, you must use the :js`addButton` function on the WysiHat global object. It requires a name, and an object of properties and methods. One of these properties is required: `label`. It will be the text on your button.

    WysiHat.addButton("ytLink", {
        'label': EE.rte.quickLink.add
        // properties and methods
    });

Your button, named _ytLink_, is now ready for use. You can also declare a `toggle-text`, which will become the button's label when the button is activated.

## Responding to Events

A button needs to be able to respond to its click event. This is done in the button's `handler` method. Let's add one now: :

    WysiHat.addButton("ytLink", {
        'label': EE.rte.ytLink.add,
        handler: function()
        {
            alert('clicked!');
        }
    });

This works, but it's not particularly interesting. Luckily the editor provides us with some utility methods to manipulate the current selection. Let's begin with a simple requirement: the user must have text selected.

    WysiHat.addButton("ytLink", {
        'label': EE.rte.ytLink.add,
        handler: function()
        {
            if (this.Selection.toString() == '')
            {
                alert('you must select text');
                return;
            }
        }
    });

NOTE: **Note:** Do not return `false` when bailing out early as we are doing here. The return value is reserved for triggering async mode, covered below.

Here we are using the editor's selection utility to quickly check for the contents of the selection. The selection utility is used for simple range manipulation. It is merely concerned with text, so falling back to ranges may still be appropriate.

## Modifying the Text

With that out of the way, we will want to actually create a YouTube link. To do that, we can use the button's `make` method, which will handle the more intricate details for us.

    WysiHat.addButton("ytLink", {
        'label': EE.rte.ytLink.add,
        handler: function()
        {
            if (this.Selection.toString() == '')
            {
                alert('you must select text');
                return;
            }

            this.make('link', 'https://youtube.com');
        }
    });

Now it would be nice if we could ask the user for a video ID to use. So we will add an overlay to prompt the user for an ID.

    WysiHat.addButton("ytLink", {
        'label': EE.rte.ytLink.add,
        handler: function(state)
        {
            if (this.Selection.toString() == '')
            {
                alert('you must select text');
                return;
            }
            this.state = state;
            this._prompt('Youtube ID:');
        },
        _prompt: function(text)
        {
            var $input = $('<input type="text" value="" />');
            this.$target = $('<form>', {
                html: '<span>'+text+'</span>',
                submit: $.proxy(this, '_createLink', $input)
            })
            .append($input)
            .dialog({
                modal: true,
                open: function() {
                    setTimeout($.proxy($input, 'focus'), 10);
                }
            });
        },
        _createLink: function($input)
        {
            this.$target.dialog('close');
            this.Selection.set(this.state.selection);
            this.make('link', 'https://youtube.com/watch?v=' + $input.val());
            return false;
        }
    });

That was a lot, let's look at it in more detail. The `_prompt` method is not very interesting, it is mostly jQuery UI boilerplate. In `_createLink` we first close the dialog, reselect the editor, and then create the link.

What we didn't cover above is that the handler always receives two parameters. The first is the starting state of the editor. This contains the current HTML and the selection as it is returned from the selection utility. We save this and reselect the text when we're ready to modify the editor again.

So now let's talk about the second parameter ...

## Async Mode

While the above works fairly well at first glance, it breaks the editor's undo feature. Normally, the editor stores the state changes for all actions to make sure that undoing works intuitively. This storing action runs after the handler is completely. When we do something asynchronous, such as waiting for an AJAX request or waiting for user input, the new state isn't any different from the old.

To account for this, the finalizing code is passed to your handler as the second parameter. To signal that you want to run the finalizer yourself, you must return `false` from the handler. Let's retrofit our code to do this:

    handler: function(state, finalize)
    {
        if (this.Selection.toString() == '')
        {
            alert('you must select text');
            return;
        }
        this.state = state;
        this.finalize = finalize;

        this._prompt('Youtube ID:');
        return false;
    },

    // [prompt ...]

    _createLink: function($input)
    {
        this.$target.dialog('close');
        this.Selection.set(this.state.selection);
        this.make('link', 'https://youtube.com/watch?v=' + $input.val());
        this.finalize();
        return false;
    }

NOTE: **Note:** You must **always** call finalize. Even if an AJAX request fails or the user decides to cancel his or her action.
