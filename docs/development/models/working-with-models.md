# Working with Models

All ExpressionEngine models (both built-in and third-party) can be accessed and manipulated using [model service](development/services/model.md).

The model service allows you to [fetch model instances](development/services/model/fetching.md) and grab their [relationships](development/services/model/relationships.md) as well as perform changes.

All models have a [set of methods](development/services/model/building-your-own.md#model-methods) available to get and set the data, however some models also define their own set of methods.

These are the most commonly used models in ExpressionEngine. For a full list, see the source `/system/ee/ExpressionEngine/Model/`
