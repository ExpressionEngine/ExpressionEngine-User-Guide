# Automated Upgrading

[TOC]

Add-ons can be automatically upgraded during the ExpressionEngine core upgrading process, if the user has opted to do so.

## The upgrade.addon_name.php File

The upgrade.addon_name.php file allows your add-on to hook into the EE upgrade process to run code at various stages of the upgrade process.

For example:

upgrade.my_awesome_plugin.php

```
<?php

class My_awesome_plugin_upgrade {

	public function upgrade($version)
	{
		
		if(version_compare($version, '3.0.0', '=')) {
			// Run updates for upgrade to EE3
		}

		if(version_compare($version, '4.0.0', '=')) {
			// Run updates for upgrade to EE3
		}

	}

}
```

The upgrade function is run at each minor version update of the ExpressionEngine process. If your add-on has an `upgrade.addon_name.php`, where `addon_name` is the snake_case name of your add-on, ExpressionEngine will automatically run the `upgrade` function at each version update.

The add-on `upgrade` function should accept a parameter `$version` that will be the current stepped version in the ExpressionEngine update process.
