# Channel Model Extension Hooks

[TOC=3]

### `before_channel_insert($channel, $values)`

| Parameter | Type     | Description                                    |
| --------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| \$channel | `Object` | Current Channel model object                   |
| \$values  | `Array`  | The Channel model object data as an array      |
| Returns   | `NULL`   | void                                           |

Called before the channel object is inserted. Changes made to the object will be saved automatically.

How it's called:

    ee()->extensions->call('before_channel_insert', $this, $this->getValues());

### `after_channel_insert($channel, $values)`

| Parameter | Type     | Description                                    |
| --------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| \$channel | `Object` | Current Channel model object                   |
| \$values  | `Array`  | The Channel model object data as an array      |
| Returns   | `NULL`   | void                                           |

Called after the channel object is inserted. Changes made to the object object will **not** be saved automatically. Saving the object may trigger the save and update hooks.

How it's called:

    ee()->extensions->call('after_channel_insert', $this, $this->getValues());

### `before_channel_update($channel, $values, $modified)`

| Parameter  | Type     | Description                                      |
| ---------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| \$channel  | `Object` | Current Channel model object                     |
| \$values   | `Array`  | The Channel model object data as an array        |
| \$modified | `Array`  | An array of all the old values that were changed |
| Returns    | `NULL`   | void                                             |

Called before the channel object is updated. Changes made to the object will be saved automatically.

How it's called:

    ee()->extensions->call('before_channel_update', $this, $this->getValues(), $modified);

### `after_channel_update($channel, $values, $modified)`

| Parameter  | Type     | Description                                      |
| ---------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| \$channel  | `Object` | Current Channelmodel object                      |
| \$values   | `Array`  | The Channel model object data as an array        |
| \$modified | `Array`  | An array of all the old values that were changed |
| Returns    | `NULL`   | void                                             |

Called after the channel object is updated. Changes made to the object will **not** be saved automatically. Calling save may fire additional hooks.

How it's called:

    ee()->extensions->call('after_channel_update', $this, $this->getValues(), $modified);

### `before_channel_save($channel, $values)`

| Parameter | Type     | Description                                    |
| --------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| \$channel | `Object` | Current Channel model object                   |
| \$values  | `Array`  | The Channel model object data as an array      |
| Returns   | `NULL`   | void                                           |

### `after_channel_save($channel, $values)`

| Parameter | Type     | Description                                    |

Called before the channel object is deleted. If you are conditionally deleting one of your own models, please consider creating an [inverse relationship](development/services/model/relating-models.md#inverse-relationships) instead. This will provide better performance and strictly enforce data consistency.

    ee()->extensions->call('before_channel_delete', $this, $this->getValues());

| Parameter | Type     | Description                                    |

| \$channel | `Object` | Current Channel model object                   |
| \$values  | `Array`  | The Channel model object data as an array      |
| Returns   | `NULL`   | void                                           |
