# ChannelFormSettings Model Extension Hooks

[TOC=3]

### `before_channel_form_settings_insert($channel, $values)`

| Parameter | Type     | Description                                           |
| --------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------|
| \$channel | `Object` | Current ChannelFormSettings model object              |
| \$values  | `Array`  | The ChannelFormSettings model object data as an array |
| Returns   | `NULL`   | void                                                  |

Called before the channel form settings object is inserted. Changes made to the object will be saved automatically.

How it's called:

    ee()->extensions->call('before_channel_form_settings_insert', $this, $this->getValues());

### `after_channel_form_settings_insert($channel, $values)`

| Parameter | Type     | Description                                           |
| --------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------|

| Returns   | `NULL`   | void                                                  |

Called after the channel form settings object is inserted. Changes made to the object object will **not** be saved automatically. Saving the object may trigger the save and update hooks.

How it's called:

    ee()->extensions->call('after_channel_form_settings_insert', $this, $this->getValues());

### `before_channel_form_settings_update($channel, $values, $modified)`

Called before the channel form settings object is deleted. If you are conditionally deleting one of your own models, please consider creating an [inverse relationship](development/services/model/relating-models.md#inverse-relationships) instead. This will provide better performance and strictly enforce data consistency.
