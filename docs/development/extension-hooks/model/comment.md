# Comment Model Extension Hooks

### `before_comment_insert($comment, $values)`

| Parameter | Type     | Description                               |
| --------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| \$comment | `Object` | Current comment model object              |
| \$values  | `Array`  | The comment model object data as an array |
| Returns   | `NULL`   | void                                      |

Called before the comment object is inserted. Changes made to the object will be saved automatically.

How it's called:

    ee()->extensions->call('before_comment_insert', $this, $this->getValues());

### `after_comment_insert($comment, $values)`

| Parameter | Type     | Description                               |

| Returns   | `NULL`   | void                                      |

Called after the comment object is inserted. Changes made to the object object will **not** be saved automatically. Saving the object may trigger the save and update hooks.

How it's called:

    ee()->extensions->call('after_comment_insert', $this, $this->getValues());

### `before_comment_update($comment, $values, $modified)`

| Parameter  | Type     | Description                                      |

| \$values   | `Array`  | The comment model object data as an array        |
| \$modified | `Array`  | An array of all the old values that were changed |
| Returns    | `NULL`   | void                                             |

Called before the comment object is updated. Changes made to the object will be saved automatically.

How it's called:

    ee()->extensions->call('before_comment_update', $this, $this->getValues(), $modified);

### `after_comment_update($comment, $values, $modified)`

| Parameter  | Type     | Description                                      |

Called after the comment object is updated. Changes made to the object will **not** be saved automatically. Calling save may fire additional hooks.

How it's called:

    ee()->extensions->call('after_comment_update', $this, $this->getValues(), $modified);

### `before_comment_save($comment, $values)`

### `before_comment_bulk_delete($delete_ids)`

    ee()->extensions->call('before_comment_bulk_delete', $delete_ids);

TIP: **New in version 4.3.0.**

### `after_comment_bulk_delete($delete_ids)`
