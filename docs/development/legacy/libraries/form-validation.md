# Form Validation Class

[TOC]

## Usage of Form Validation Class

**class `Form_validation`**

The Form Validation class provides comprehensive validation framework to minimize the amount of code you need to write. It provides a toolset for validating user input, showing validation errors, and repopulating form fields.

The base functionality for the Form Validation class is inherited from the corresponding CodeIgniter library---refer to the [Form Validation](https://www.codeigniter.com/userguide2/libraries/form_validation.html) documentation in the CodeIgniter user guide for details.

## Setting Reference Values

For member screen names, member usernames, and member email addresses the Form Validation class needs a reference value. This value will be ignored when checking for duplicates.

### `set_old_value($key[, $value = ''])`

| Parameter | Type     | Description                                                                                          |
| --------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| \$key     | `Mixed`  | Name of input or associative array containing input names as the keys and their values as the values |
| \$val     | `String` | The value to set                                                                                     |
| Returns   | `Void`   |                                                                                                      |

Is used to set a reference value for a given key:

    ee()->form_validation->set_old_value($key, $value)

### `old_value($key)`

| Parameter | Type     | Description                              |
| --------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| \$key     | `String` | Name of the input to retrieve            |
| Returns   | `String` | Data of the value associated with `$key` |

Can be used to retrieve a reference value that was previously set. This method is primarily used internally:

    ee()->form_validation->old_value($key)

## User Specific Rules

A few rules are provided to check for illegal characters, validate input lengths, and check for duplicates on member fields.

### valid_username

Checks the username for invalid characters, as well as making sure no duplicates exist. It takes an optional parameter to indicate if this is a new user. Expects that a reference value for `username` was set before running the validation:

    ee()->form_validation->set_rules('username', 'Username', 'required|valid_username');
    ee()->form_validation->set_rules('username', 'Username', 'required|valid_username[new]');

### valid_screen_name

Works the same way as the valid_username rule. Expects that a reference value for `screen_name` was set before running the validation:

    ee()->form_validation->set_old_value('screen_name', 'Bob');
    ee()->form_validation->set_rules('screen_name', 'Screen Name', 'required|valid_screen_name');

### valid_user_email

Identical to the previous rules, but expects the reference value to be set for `email`:

    // Note: no reference value is needed if this is a new user
    ee()->form_validation->set_rules('email', 'lang:email', 'required|valid_user_email[new]');

### valid_password

Checks the submitted password for weaknesses and illegal characters. Takes the name of a username field as a parameter, which is used to prevent a password that is based on the username. This rule _does not_ check user credentials:

    ee()->form_validation->set_rules('password', 'lang:password', 'required|valid_password[username]');

## Prepping Methods

These are convenience methods to help sanitize and validate frequently used input data patterns.

### prep_list

Replaces all commas, pipes, and whitespace (tabs, newlines, and spaces) with a given delimiter:

    ee()->form_validation->set_rules('emails', 'lang:emails', 'required|prep_list[,]|valid_emails');
