# Field Groups

[TOC]

Every Form consists of Field Groups that contain Field Sets. The below covers everything about Field Groups and how they work with Field Sets. 

## Usage

When working with Field Groups, you'll always request it from the [`Cp\form`](development/services/cp-form.md) object to request it, initially. Once you have a Field Group, you'll decorate it like everything else. For example:

```
$form = ee('CP/Form');
$field_group = $form->getGroup('General Settings');
```

In the above, `$field_group` will contain our Field object. Once we have it, we can start adding Field Sets to it and really craft our Form. 

```
$field_set = $field_group->getFieldSet('First Name');
```

TIP: If your Form object is set to be a Tabbed form, it's the Groups that make up the Tab layer
