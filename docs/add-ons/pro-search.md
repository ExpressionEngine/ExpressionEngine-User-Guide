# Pro Search

ExpressionEngineâ€™s native `channel:entries` tag allows you to fetch and filter entries in many ways by setting its parameters. The native Search module allows for filtering by keyword, but is limited in its capabilities. Pro Search combines the two into one module and then throw in extra features, filters, and a performance boost. That is Low Search.

NOTE:**Note:** Documentation for Pro Search is still being migrated. Until this is complete, please refernce the [Low Search documentation on EEHarbor's website](https://eeharbor.com/low-search). For any tags, simply replace `low_search` with `pro_search`.
