# Structure

Structure is a powerful add-on that lets you create pages, generate navigation, manage content through a simple interface and build robust sites faster than ever.

It forgoes the default template_group/template setup and creates “static” and “listing” pages that are all editable through a tree sitemap view. With Structure enabled, traditional page style content and multiple entry pages can live within the same area.

NOTE:**Note:** Documentation for Structure is still being migrated. Until this is complete, please reference the [Structure documentation on EEHarbor's website](https://eeharbor.com/structure/documentation).

NOTE:**Note:** See the [template generator](control-panel/template-manager.md#template-generators) for the structure templates in ExpressionEngine 7.5+.
