# Overview
Pro Variables allows you to go beyond the standard Template Variables and Template Partials by giving you the ability to group your variables, change parse order of variables, control who can edit variables, and use multiple fieldtypes as variables.

In addition you can add notes to groups and variables, sort groups and variables using drag and drop, clone variables, batch-create variables, and duplicate whole groups. There is also a Pro Variables fieldtype so you can add global variables to your channel entries, and an API so you can create your own variable types or create Pro Variables compatible field types.
