# Lexicon

Pro Search contains a lexicon which is used for keyword suggestions as well as diacritic-insensitive highlighting of keywords in an entryâ€™s search excerpt or title. Words are unique per site and language. For collections that have a language defined, the words will be added to the lexicon automatically. However, deleting entries will not remove words from the lexicon.

## Managing the lexicon manually

To add words, click the Add words tab on the lexicon page in the Control Panel, enter the word you want to add, make sure the correct language is selected, and hit return.

To remove words, click the Find words tab on the lexicon page in the Control Panel, enter the word you want to remove, make sure the correct language is selected, and hit return. A list of matching words will appear on the page. Then click on the word you want to remove.

Finding words in this manner also supports partial matches. For example, use lion to look up the exact word, or use lion* to look for words that start with lion.

NOTE**Note:** Only 3+-letter non-digit words will be added to the lexicon.
