# Add-Ons

Add-ons can extend the functionality of ExpressionEngine, adding more features, fields, template tags, and more!

Visit the [Add-on Store](https://expressionengine.com/add-ons) to browse available add-ons.

## Installing Add-ons

Installing an add-on is easy!

1. Download the add-on and unzip its contents.
2. Upload the add-on's folder to your `system/user/addons/` folder.
3. Once the add-on is uploaded, you should see it listed in the [Add-on Manager](control-panel/addons-manager.md) in your ExpressionEngine Control Panel. You can then click install!
