# CLI Usage

Commands can be called in the terminal of your choice in the format of:

`$ php eecli hello`

This will call `eecli` with a command of `hello`. This is the Hello World of EE commands, and will display:

`Hello world`

Commands can also request confirmation:

```
$ php eecli hello -c

Hello world
Are you liking these questions? (yes/no) [no]
yes
That's good to hear!
```

Commands are also able to take interaction:

```
$ php eecli hello -i
