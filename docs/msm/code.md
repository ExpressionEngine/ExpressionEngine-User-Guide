# Multiple Site Manager Variables and Parameter

[TOC]

## Parameter

The Multiple Site Manager enables the use of the `site=""` parameter installation wide. This parameter will be used when you want to pull the content of one Site into another Site's templates. The value of the parameter is always the Site's Short Name.

The `site=""` parameter is available to the following:

- Channel Module: Every single tag.
- Comment Module: Every single tag.
- RSS Module
- Search Module
- Statistics Module

When you use the `site=""` parameter it will exclude all other Sites. If the site="" parameter is not specified then the current site is used.

### Embedding Templates from Another Site

To embed a template from another Site, simply prefix the template group and template specified with the short name of the site you wish to pull the template from as follows:

    {embed="site_short_name:template_group/template"}
 
 ### Template Layouts from Another Site

It is also possible to share a Template Layout from another Site, again, simply prefix the template group and template specified with the short name of the site you wish to pull the template from:

    {layout="site_short_name:template_group/layout_template"}   

### Specifying Multiple Sites (prepare for a head trip)

NOTE: **Note:** Specifying multiple Sites does not work with the {embed=""} tag.

When using the `site=""` parameter in the Channel, Comment, Statistics, and RSS modules you can specify multiple Sites like so:

    site="siteA|siteB|siteC"

Like other ExpressionEngine parameters, you can also use 'not' to specify what Sites not to show:

    site="not SiteD"

Let's pause a moment to remember that each Site is independent of other Sites. This means you can have Channels that have the same short_name. The implications of this are far reaching and provide a lot of flexibility but will also require careful consideration.

For example, let's say you have SiteA, SiteB, and SiteC. Each of these Sites has a "news" channel which uses the Channel Short Name of "news". The following code would display the "news" channels from all the Sites:

    {exp:channel:entries channel="news" site="siteA|siteB|siteC"}

Within the channel entries tag, it is possible to output a list of entries from multiple Sites while ordering by Site and Channel Field. Read more about the [Multiple Site Manager and orderby=](channels/entries.md#orderby).

## Variables

The following Global Variables are available with the Multiple Site Manager:

- `{site_id}`: Displays the Site's ID number.
- `{site_label}`: Displays the Site's Label.
- `{site_short_name}`: Displays the Site's Short Name.
