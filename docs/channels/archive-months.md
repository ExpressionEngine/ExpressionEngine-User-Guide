# Archive Month Links Tag

[TOC]

## Overview

The Archive Month Links tag displays a list of links for any months that contain Channel Entries. The links will point to your monthly archive page. The links created by the tag look like this:

- October, 2011
- September, 2011
- August, 2011
- July, 2011
- June, 2011

Here is the basic tag prototype:

    {exp:channel:month_links channel="news" limit="50"}
        {month}, {year}<br>
    {/exp:channel:month_links}

## Parameters

[TOC=3]

### `channel=`

    channel="news"

The name of the channel you want to limit the query to.

### `limit=`

    limit="10"

The number of rows to return.

### `sort=`

    sort="asc" sort="desc"

The sort order can be ascending or descending. The order will default to "descending" if nothing is specified.

### `show_expired=`

    show_expired="yes"

You can determine whether you wish for entries that have "expired" to be included.

### `show_future_entries=`

    show_future_entries="yes"

You can determine whether you wish for entries dated in the "future" to be included. This option is useful when doing things like creating a list of events, some of which have not occurred yet.

### `status=`

    status="open"

You may restrict to entries with a particular [status](control-panel/channels.md#statuses-tab). The two statuses "open" and "closed" are default statuses that are always available, so you can always specify those if needed. You can choose multiple statuses using a pipe:

    status="draft|reviewed|published"

Or exclude statuses using "not"

    status="not submitted|processing|closed"
