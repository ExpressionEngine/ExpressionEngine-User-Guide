## Enabling Entry Cloning
### Global
Entry Cloning is enabled by default when ExpressionEngine is installed. Entry Cloning can be disabled globally for your site via the ["enable entry cloning" setting](settings/content-design.md#enable-entry-cloning) setting or the matching [Config Override.](general/system-configuration-overrides.md#enable_entry_cloning)

### Per Channel
for all channels. Disabling, or later enable, Entry Cloning for a specific channel can be done from the [channel settings page](control-panel/channels.md#settings-tab).

## Cloning An Entry
To clone an entry, open the original entry from the Entry Manager. Then click  Save -> Clone to New Entry.

You will then be redirected to the new entry. Note that the new entry will have a status of `Closed`, and the Title will automatically be prefixed with "Copy of" to prevent confusion with your original entry.
