# ExpressionEngine Pro Overview

[TOC]

## What is a ExpressionEngine Pro?

ExpressionEngine Pro is first-party add-on that can be installed to make your content management experience even better.

ExpressionEngine Pro is bundled with 2 other add-ons: Low Variables and Low Search, which are installed automatically when you install Pro.

## ExpressionEngine Pro Features

### CP Branding

ExpressionEngine Pro allows uploading custom logo to be used on CP login page as well as favicon for CP pages.

### Customizable Dashboard

With ExpressionEngine Pro installed, Control Panel homepage can be completely customizable. Pro is being shipped with a set of dashboard widgets that can be shown, hidden or reordered. Each member can customize their own dashboard layout.

Third-party add-ons can provide their own widgets using PHP or EE template tags.

### The Dock

Dock is the floating bar that is being displayed on front-end page that provides quick access to the Control Panel and to EE Pro's front-end facing features.

### Front-end Editing

For admin members with appropriate level of access ExpressionEngine Pro adds "quick edit" links on the site's frontend that allow editing contents of each entry field individually, directly on front-end without going to the control panel.

Clicking the link opens a popup with the field that can be modified and saved; as well it presents the link to edit full entry with live preview showing the current page you are on.

### Prolets

Prolets are add-on components that reveal some of add-on's functionality for the CP to the frontend, making possible to edit data directly on page where it belongs.
