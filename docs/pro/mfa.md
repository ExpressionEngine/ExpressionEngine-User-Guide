# Multi-Factor Authentication

Multi-factor authentication adds an extra level of protection to the Control Panel by relying on one-time password generated by Multi-factor authentication applications like Google Authenticator, Microsoft Authenticator or Authy.

## Enabling MFA

### Enabling MFA per Member
With ExpressionEngine Pro installed, users with Control Panel access can enable/disable Multi-factor authentication via their [profile](control-panel/member-profile.html) in the Control Panel.

### Requiring MFA For A Role
Multi-Factor Authentication can also be set as required for certain [Member Roles](control-panel/member-manager.html#member-roles)

Members with a primary role where this option is enabled will be required to use MFA to log in via a front-end login form or when accessing the Control Panel (if allowed access).

If the member has not yet set up their multi-factor authentication, upon login they will be redirected to a page where they can scan QR code using their MFA app and then enter the provided one-time password (OTP) to complete the setup.


## Setting Up MFA With Front-end Member Forms

Setting up Multi-Factor Authentication on the front-end is handled using a set of system dialogs. These dialogs can be triggered manually using the links provided by the [`{exp:member:mfa_links}` tag](member/mfa.md).

The dialogs are presented using `Multi-Factor Authentication Template` from System Message Templates. You can also use a custom template from the [`system_messages` template group](/control-panel/template-manager.md#custom-system-messages), it should be named `mfa_template`.


## Resetting MFA

In case when the device that was used to scan QR code for MFA is not available, it is possible to reset multi-factor authentication using the backup code that has been provided together with the QR code. 

## Disabling MFA

MFA can be disabled after the member has logged in and completed second-factor authentication. As additional protection measure, the password is being asked.
