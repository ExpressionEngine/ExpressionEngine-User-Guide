# Dashboard Management

Each member can show, hide, or rearrange [Dashboard Widgets](pro/development/widgets.md) to customize their own Control Panel homepage. 

To manage what is being shown:

- Click the gear icon in top right corner of homepage ( <img style="margin-bottom: 0px; vertical-align: middle;" src="../_images/dashboard_gear_icon.png" alt="layout edit icon"> ). 
- Hide or unhide and change widgets using the visibility icon in the top right of each widget ( <img style="margin-bottom: 0px; vertical-align: middle;" src="../_images/pro_visibility.png" alt="visibility icon"> ).
- Rearrange widget using the grab handle in the top left of each widget ( <img style="margin-bottom: 0px; vertical-align: middle;" src="../_images/pro_grab.png" alt="visibility icon"> ). Simply grab the handle and drag the widget to a new position. Note that widget widths are declared in the code for the widget. Widget widths cannot be changed from the Dashboard edit view.

Dashboard layouts are saved on per-member basis.
