# Front-end content management

[TOC]

For admin members with appropriate level of access ExpressionEngine Pro adds "quick edit" links on the site's frontend that allow editing contents of each entry field individually, directly on front-end without going to the control panel.

Clicking the link opens a popup with the field that can be modified and saved; as well it presents the link to edit full entry with live preview showing the current page you are on.

This feature can be switched off using the switch in the Dock, or disabled completely with configuration override.
